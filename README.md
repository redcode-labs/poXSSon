## What is this project?
This tool gathers some of the most reliable and useful Javascript payloads that can be used in client-side attacks or while testing security posture of a web application.
They can be adapted and modified to your specific needs.

## Installation
All of the required deps can be easily installed via command:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

## Project details

### MultiplePayloads()
Choose from several code templates to grab keystrokes, execute system commands and exfiltrate important data from target host. Save generated payload to a file or clipboard for further use.

### HighlyEVasive()
Specify encoding schemes, custom script tags, format conversions and polyglot executors using intuitive command-line interface.

### FullyCustomizable()
Msfvenom-like approach for specifying options enables you to quickly tweak any payload. Every aspect of the payload's logic can be modified, allowing unique behaviour depending on what system you target.

### RealTimeMonitoring()
Most payloads come with a built-in PHP handler that can be launched after generating code template. It listens for status messages and data harvested by the launched payload.
